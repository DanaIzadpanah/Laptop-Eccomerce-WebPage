    <h4 style="text-align: center;">ThinkPad Carbon X1 Gen 9:</h4>
    <p>"I bought the fedora version of this machine, and it is great, 
    I absolutely love it. It is fast, reliable and great for work as a developer. The Fedora edition worked flawlessly out of the box, the only downside was that it comes with Fedora 33 which is EOS so I needed to upgrade to 35 right away which only took about 5 minutes.
    Overall, I would definitely recommend the Fedora edition for
     anyone that is a developer and trying to decide between this or a Macbook."</p>

    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Dell Latitude 5420 Laptop</h4>
    <p>
        "I love this laptop, the only addition I made was to upgrade the memory, but I've done that on new laptops.
It's a refurbished machine so how well the one you receive performs is pretty much a roll 
of the dice and it always seems to be a case of 
heaven or very far below heaven. The laptop can pass all the quality checks and tests flawlessly then 
somewhere in transit poltergeists take up residence.
I learned instead of dealing with any problem, to just ship it 
right back for an exchange. Yes, that's annoying and you will lose time but not as much as 
you will trying to fix it before you end up returning it. Besides once you start it never seems 
to be just one thing you're fixing.
I 've often had to argue that it is indeed going back because I bought a 
machine to use not fix, but it's worth it. You'll have, one phone conversation not 3, a 
laptop you'd give 4 or5-stars and saved several hundred dollars."

    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Microsoft Surface Pro 4</h4>
    <p>"I have been waiting to review this little gem in case something happens in the first month. So far so good. I got the Pro X for the SIM option to be connected from anywhere. I need constant connection working in construction, from job site to job site. The ARM chip sure make startup and shutdown fast. The sleep on this device actually works, don't have to wait long for it to jump back to life. With cloud connected apps, I don't need a lot of storage and the keyboard (bought separately) works better than any crappy iPad accessory. Having the full power of Windows 11 (I upgraded) give me way more functionality that any iPad could for construction field work. I got a killer bullet proof case to hold this lightweight champion."</p>
